For a long time, I've enjoyed working with teams to build exceptional products. A core part of that is facilitating clear communication and working practices to ensure we do the best job we can. I really enjoy this aspect of working with teams in different environments (and I also appreciate not everyone enjoys this aspect).

[Andy's thoughts on this resonated with me](https://css-tricks.com/the-importance-of-investing-in-soft-skills-in-the-age-of-ai/). Working on communication, organisation, and decision making structures is just as much of a creative act as the coding itself. Problem solving when it comes to diagnosing miscommunications, inefficient organisation or a lack of decision making clarity can be the difference between a team that ships and a team that doesn't.

**It is just as important (maybe even more important) as the technical output.**

AI will never replace this. The enjoyment you get from a team that is truly aligned and working together on a shared objective. The celebrations of the wins. The triaging of problems. Sure, AI can support the diagnosis and resolution in one way or another. But having a team of humans who genuinely love the process of creating? That's priceless. And untouchable by AI.
