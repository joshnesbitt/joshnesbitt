[A post](https://cassidoo.co/post/introduce-friction/) landed in my inbox this morning from the fantastic [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/), on the value of introducing friction into everyday life. We have become way too acustomed to the immediate availability of most things that it can be hard to remember the true value of having to work for something.

Friction in a product context can be a bad thing. This topic tends to divide the room. Let's take the process of learning as an example to work off.

You might expect that a technologist, someone like myself, to take the side that allows for the immediate and pain-free introduction and storage of knowledge as a way to learn. Downloading an entire curriculum's worth of information should be the easy part, and the application of that knowledge is where the real value lies.

But it isn't. A learning process full of challenges can lead to better results. You evolve through understanding how to overcome those challenges. Some of these skills are directly applicable to how you'd confidently solve real-world challenges. A simple path doesn't give you the opportunity to apply those same skills. You may understand a topic at the end of it, but without real world challenges, applying that topic can be difficult.

Friction, on the other hand, may not always be helpful, either. Friction could indicate that something is unnessarily hard. Learning should be made accessible through tools, for example, but they should not circumvent the learning process entirely.

WHERE THE FUCK AM I GOING WITH THIS.
