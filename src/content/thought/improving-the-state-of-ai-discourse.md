I know we like to fall out with people on the internet, but bear with me for a moment.

This [recent post from Steve](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-am-disappointed-in-the-ai-discourse/) helped articulate an uncomfortable feeling I've had for some time now, which is that collectively, as a community, we're pretty rubbish at talking about AI.

Whether you think it's the new snake oil or not, AI is here to stay, and will leave a lasting legacy on software engineering and more widely, technology.

Ways to improve the discourse:

* Understand your feelings on it more deeply: ?
* Check your facts: ?
