# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh, a software engineer and technical leader. My work spans from hands-on projects building large platforms to leading some of the best-performing teams in our industry.

I also run internationally recognised conferences and events, which bring people from all over the world to the heart of Leeds to learn, inspire and share stories.
