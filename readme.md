# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh. I made Stac to [help companies build better software](https://stac.works/nice-words). I also want to help teams work better together. A large part of what I do is working alongside teams to improve engineering culture, through things like [mentoring and workshops](https://stac.works/projects/sky-ruby-workshops). I've ran [entire software teams](https://stac.works/projects/ladbible-head-of-software-engineering) as a Head of Software Engineering, through to working as a Software Engineer to deliver [massive projects](https://stac.works/projects/nhs-nhsx-learning-platform) in the best way possible.

It was working with so many people that helped me start [Hey!](https://stac.works/events/hey) and [All Day Hey!](https://stac.works/events/all-day-hey), events designed to empower and educate people, not only about technology but important topics such as mental health and how to look after yourself in an industry that's moving at a thousand miles an hour.
